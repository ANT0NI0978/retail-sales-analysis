# Retail Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This personal project analyzes retail sales data to uncover patterns in customer behavior, spending, and product performance. The goal is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills using Python and common analytics tools.

## Dataset
- Synthetic retail sales dataset
- 1,000 transactions
- Includes customer demographics, product categories, and transaction values

## Questions Explored
- Which product category generates the most revenue?
- Does customer age relate to spending behavior?
- Are there gender-based purchasing differences?
- What is the average order value by category?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel

## Key Findings
- Electronics generated the highest total revenue.
- Age showed a very weak relationship with per-transaction spending.
- Gender-based differences varied by category but balanced overall.
- Beauty products had the highest average order value.

## Files
- `retail_sales_analysis.ipynb` - main analysis notebook  
- `excel_output/retail_sales_analysis.xlsx` - exported results  
- `data/retail_sales_dataset.csv` - dataset  

## Limitations
- Dataset is synthetic and may not reflect real-world business outcomes.
- Analysis focuses on per-transaction behavior rather than customer lifetime value.
